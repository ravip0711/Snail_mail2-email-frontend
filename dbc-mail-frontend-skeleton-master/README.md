# DBC Mail - Frontend Skeleton

This skeleton is designed for client side applications (just HTML, CSS & JS). It
includes the following Javascipt libraries:

* jQuery
* underscore.js
* modernizer

A boilerplate `index.html` is also included, sourced from the
[Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) project.

Within the `<body>` tag of `index.html` a single `<div>` has been is included.
This single div is designed to hold all of your content. It's styled to emulate
the dimensions of an iPhone 5 (320px x 568px).

Instead of opening `index.html` with your browser as a file, it's best to serve
all the files in the skeleton over the network with a simple HTTP server. This
simulates how your client side application will consumed in the real world.

A quick & dirty HTTP server is included with the standard Python installation. You
can serve any files over the network by running: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
Now all the files (including the `index.html`) will be available on
`http://localhost:8000`.
